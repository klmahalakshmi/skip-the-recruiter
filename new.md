# Skip The Recruiter and find who the client is.

> **THIS TOOL DOES NOT EXIST**: I am hoping to find a way that the tool does not actually allow a candidate to bunny hop a recruiter that is actually helping the client. This will **NOT BE BUILT** if there is no reliable mechanism to actually tell if a recruiter has rehashed a job specification from a job listings site.

> **ETHICAL NOTICE**: I actually have a shortlist of fantastic recruiters. **This project is only to be used with recruiters who are NOT instructed by the client** that job boards of real listings and have basically "invited themselves" to recruit for this position.

> **BEFORE YOU USE THIS TOOL**: Please consider that **recruiters are sometimes vital** and **recruiters are sometimes NOT JUST CV SHUFFLERS** so there may be times when the client hasn't directly instructed a recruitment firm, but **the client is struggling to fill a job position** (think: Kotlin/Scala, Go devs, Node.js devs, .NET Core devs, PHP devs - they're all in demand!) - so this isn't always the right tool to use as that recruiter may actually have a great rolodex of developers.

## WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH RECRUIMENT??

A lot of folks don't know this, but recruiters could be the reason you lose a great job.

Recruiters can actually cost the client the best applicant because of the huge fees.

Permanent recruitment has a **sky high fee between 5% and 20%** of your first year salary. This fee can get silly quite quickly, especially if you need to say - fill 3 Node.js positions that's sometimes >Â£15K+ in fees.

Every project I have worked on, the management discounted applicants who come at a huge fee of the first year salary.

This fee is not appropriate if the recruiter just mails everybody in their list and then loads of folks apply. A jobseeker will already be subscribed to job boards.

The consequence is you may be given a code test for a job that doesn't exist OR the client actually knows they're probably not going to use the recruitment firm.

## But you said that some recruiters are good?

Yes, some recruiters are good. But **the client should instruct the firm to find the candidate**. This project would be a way to find out if a recruiter is not actually the preferred recruitment agency of the client.

## What could this do that was useful and ethical?

- It could ensure that the job is not listed somewhere else where you can go direct and have better chances of securing your dream job.
- It could contact the client to verify the recruiter is the preferred recruiter, if they verify the job, then we list it on a website.
  - This actually would **help** recruiters as we would have a list of jobs that the client has specifically instructed to do the job.
- We could weirdly use this referral fee for good.
  - If the recruiter IS actually helping the client fill hard-to-fill roles, then we could possibly use referall fees for good.
  - It could be used as a tool for referrals and this could actually be siphoned off into a kitty for open source projects.
